# Felid Classification

## Overview
This project is a deep learning model for classifying images of felids, specifically focusing on three classes: Leopard, Lion, and Tiger. The model has been trained to distinguish between these felid species with high accuracy.

## Usage
To use the Felid Classification model, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [Felid Classification Web App](https://felidclassification.streamlit.app/).
2. Upload an image of a Leopard, Lion, or Tiger.
3. You can classification bar

The model will analyze the uploaded image and provide a classification result, indicating whether the image depicts a Leopard, Lion, or Tiger.

## How it Works
The underlying deep learning model has been trained on a diverse dataset of felid images, enabling it to learn distinctive features of each species. The model uses state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, providing reliable predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- FastAI Library
- Streamlit for the Web App
